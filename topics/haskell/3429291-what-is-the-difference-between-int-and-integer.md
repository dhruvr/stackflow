# What is the difference between Int and Integer?

## Question
        
In Haskell, what is the difference between an `Int` and an `Integer`? Where is the answer documented?

## Answer
        
> "Integer" is an arbitrary precision type: it will hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of your machine's memoryâ€¦. This means you never have arithmetic overflows. On the other hand it also means your arithmetic is relatively slow. Lisp users may recognise the "bignum" type here.

> "Int" is the more common 32 or 64 bit integer. Implementations vary, although it is guaranteed to be at least 30 bits.
